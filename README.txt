### 1. General Information

The Perceptron will be used for binary classification tasks on a dataset.
Multi-class classification will also be demonstrated using a 1-vs-rest approach.
L2 regularisation will also be used.


### 2. Installation

Use the package manager (pip) to install numpy.

```bash
pip install numpy
```


### 3. Usage

In order to successfully run the analysis, ensure that the data files "train.data" and "test.data" are stored in a
subdirectory "Data" of the directory containing the script file CA1_Perceptron.py.
    For example, this directory structure is demonstrated in the following GitHub repository:
